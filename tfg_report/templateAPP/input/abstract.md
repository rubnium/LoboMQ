The Internet of Things is very relevant in today's society, as it allows the creation of systems to collect and process data, as well as to transmit commands to different devices. However, the implementation of these systems presents problems in certain environments due to various difficulties and costs. These difficulties may arise from the impossibility of installing an Internet network, the high power consumption of the devices or the need to use a wireless network without an adequate infrastructure to process and transmit messages.
To solve this problem, the LoboMQ protocol is proposed, which allows to manage messages transmitted between several low-power microcontrollers using message queues inspired by the MQTT publish-subscribe pattern, and takes advantage of ESP-NOW to perform the transmissions without the need of an Internet network. The aim of the protocol development and its implementation in a C++ library is to offer a simple-to-use solution to the Internet of Things community.
